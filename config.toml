# LOLBAS Sysmon Rule Generator Configuration

# This configuration file controls how Sysmon detection rules are generated
# from LOLBAS (Living Off The Land Binaries and Scripts) data.

[categories]
# Enabled LOLBAS categories for rule generation.
# Each category maps to specific abuse techniques. Only categories listed here
# will have detection rules generated.
#
# Available categories from LOLBAS:
#   ADS            - Alternate Data Stream operations
#   AWL Bypass     - Application Whitelist bypass techniques
#   Compile        - Code compilation (e.g., csc.exe, msbuild.exe)
#   Conceal        - Hide malicious activity
#   Copy           - File copy operations
#   Credentials    - Credential access/dumping
#   Decode         - Decode encoded payloads (e.g., certutil -decode)
#   Download       - Download files from internet
#   Dump           - Memory/process dumping (e.g., lsass)
#   Encode         - Encode payloads
#   Execute        - Arbitrary code/command execution
#   Reconnaissance - System/network enumeration
#   Tamper         - Modify system settings/files
#   UAC Bypass     - User Account Control bypass
#   Upload         - Exfiltrate data

[mappings]
# Category to Sysmon Event Type Mapping.
# Maps each LOLBAS category to the appropriate Sysmon event type for detection.
#
# Sysmon Event Types used:
#   ProcessCreate  - Event ID 1: Process creation with command line
#   FileCreate     - Event ID 11: File creation
#   ProcessAccess  - Event ID 10: Process access (e.g., credential dumping)

"ADS" = "FileCreate"
"AWL Bypass" = "ProcessCreate"
"Compile" = "ProcessCreate"
"Conceal" = "ProcessCreate"
"Copy" = "FileCreate"
"Credentials" = "ProcessAccess"

"Download" = "ProcessCreate"
"Dump" = "ProcessAccess"
"Encode" = "FileCreate"
"Execute" = "ProcessCreate"
"Reconnaissance" = "ProcessCreate"

"UAC Bypass" = "ProcessCreate"

[event_conditions]
# Preferred Condition Tags by Event Type.
# Defines which XML tags to use for matching executables in each event type.
# Order matters: first tag is preferred, second is fallback.
#
# Tag types:
#   OriginalFileName - PE header original filename (harder to spoof)
#   Image            - Full executable path
#   SourceImage      - Source process in ProcessAccess events
#
# Using OriginalFileName is preferred as it's more resistant to renaming attacks.

ProcessCreate = ["OriginalFileName", "Image"]
ProcessAccess = ["SourceImage", "Image"]
FileCreate = ["Image"]

[rule_groups]
# Rule Group Naming Prefixes.
# Generated rules are organized into RuleGroups with these naming conventions.
#
# Two types of rules are generated for each category:
#   1. CMD rules (more specific) - Match executable + command-line flags
#   2. Fallback rules (broader)  - Match executable name only
#
# CMD rules are placed first in the config as they're more precise.

prefix = "LOLBAS_"
cmd_prefix = "LOLBAS_CMD_"

# Deduplication: When enabled, skip duplicate rules for same executable
# within same event type across different categories.
# Can be overridden with --unique-rules CLI flag.

unique_rules = false

# Fetched data is automatically cached to the json_file path.
